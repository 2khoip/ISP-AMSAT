Hardware/Materials
------------------

To create and interface with an antenna, you will need:

* 1x shaft or pole, such as a 2x4 or pipe approximately 6' long

* 8x smaller shafts/poles, preferably not metallic/conductive approximately 2' long

* 8x 12-24" long piano wire

* Coaxial cable (50 ohm)

* Soldering Iron/Toolkit

* RTL-SDR

* Drill + Drill bits

Assembly
--------

Essentially, we need to support the 6' shaft to be self supporting vetically, and attach dipoles on the sides offset from the center.

First, attach two of the shafts on the bottom in a cross pattern as shown in the picture below.


Then, connect the other four shaft to the top of the long shaft in the same way. 


Next take a drill with a drill bit of the same or slightly smaller diameter of your piano wire and drill holes 45 degrees in the end of the top four small shafts as seen in the photo.
